Problem:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume $x> 0$. Prove: $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
\end{tcolorbox}

Simplified proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $x>0$, we have $(x-1)^2 \ge 0$. Thus, $x - 2 + \frac{1}{x} \ge 0$, so $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{example}

Elaborated proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $x>0$, we have $(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \ge 0$. Thus, $x^2 - 2x + 1 \ge 0$, so $x^2 + 1 \ge 2x$. Since $x > 0$, dividing both sides by $x$ gives $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$.
Assume $x>0$.
The goal is to prove $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
We have $x>0$.
We have ${{(x-1)}}^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \ge 0$.
We have $x^2 - 2x + 1 \ge 0$.
We have $x^2 + 1 \ge 2x$.
We have $x > 0$.
We have $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.

Elaborated proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $x>0$ and $y>0$, we have $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$. Thus $(x-y)^2 = x^2 -2xy + y^2 \ge 0$, so $x^2 + y^2 \ge 2xy$, and hence $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x+y)^2 \ge 4xy$. Dividing by $xy(x+y)$ gives $\frac{(x+y)^2}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{x+y}{xy} = \frac{x}{xy} + \frac{y}{xy} = \frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{x} \ge \frac{4xy}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{4}{x+y}$.
\end{tcolorbox}

Regularized proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$.
Assume $x>0$.
Let $y\in\mathbb{R}$.
Assume $y>0$.
The goal is to prove $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} \ge \frac{4}{x+y}$.
We have $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
We have $x>0$.
We have $y \in \mathbb{R}$.
We have $y>0$.
It's enough to show that $\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} \ge \frac{4}{x+y}$.
We have ${(x-y)}^2 \ge 0$.
We have ${(x-y)}^2 = x^2 -2xy + y^2 \ge 0$.
We have $x^2 + y^2 \ge 2xy$.
We have $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = {(x+y)}^2 \ge 4xy$.
We have $\frac{{(x+y)}^2}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{x+y}{xy} = \frac{x}{xy} + \frac{y}{xy} = \frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{x} \ge \frac{4xy}{xy(x+y)} = \frac{4}{x+y}$.
