\begin{example}
Problem:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10, width=\linewidth]
Prove that for all real numbers $a$ and $b$:
    $$(a+b)^2 \geq 0.$$
\end{tcolorbox}

Simplified proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10, width=\linewidth]
Trivial since the square of any real number is non-negative.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{example}

Elaborated proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10, width=\linewidth]
Trivial since the square of any real number is non-negative.
\end{tcolorbox}

Regularized proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $a\in\mathbb{R}$.
Let $b\in\mathbb{R}$.
The goal is to prove ${{(a+b)}}^2 \ge 0$.
We have ${{(a+b)}}^2 \geq 0$.

\begin{example}
Problem:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10, width=\linewidth]
Prove that for any positive real numbers $x$ and $y$:
    $$\frac{x+y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}.$$
\end{tcolorbox}

Simplified proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, $(\sqrt x - \sqrt y)^2 \ge 0$. Thus $\frac{x+y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{example}

Elaborated proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, $(\sqrt x - \sqrt y)^2 = (\sqrt x)^2 - 2\sqrt x \sqrt y + (\sqrt y)^2 = x - 2\sqrt{xy} + y \ge 0$. Thus $x + y \ge 2\sqrt{xy}$, so $\frac{x+y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}$.
\end{tcolorbox}

Regularized proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume $x\ge 0$.
Let $y\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume $y\ge 0$.
The goal is to prove $\frac{x+y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}$.
We have ${{(\sqrt x - \sqrt y)}}^2 = {{(\sqrt x)}}^2 - 2\sqrt x \sqrt y + {{(\sqrt y)}}^2$.
We have ${{(\sqrt x)}}^2 - 2\sqrt x \sqrt y + {{(\sqrt y)}}^2 = x - 2\sqrt{xy} + y$.
We have $x - 2\sqrt{xy} + y \ge 0$.
We have ${{(\sqrt x - \sqrt y)}}^2 \ge 0$.
We have $x + y \ge 2\sqrt{xy}$.
We have $\frac{x+y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}$.

\begin{example}
Problem:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10, width=\linewidth]
Show that for all real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:
    $$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca.$$
\end{tcolorbox}

Simplified proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10, width=\linewidth]
We have $2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) = (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 \ge 0$. Thus, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{example}

Elaborated proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10, width=\linewidth]
We have $2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 2ab - 2bc - 2ca = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) + (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) + (c^2 - 2ca + a^2) = (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 \ge 0$. Thus, $2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) \ge 0$, so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca \ge 0$, and hence $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca$.
\end{tcolorbox}

Regularized proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $a\in\mathbb{R}$.
Let $b\in\mathbb{R}$.
Let $c\in\mathbb{R}$.
The goal is to prove $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca$.
We have $2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 2ab - 2bc - 2ca = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) + (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) + (c^2 - 2ca + a^2) = {(a-b)}^2 + {(b-c)}^2 + {(c-a)}^2$.
We have ${(a-b)}^2 + {(b-c)}^2 + {(c-a)}^2 \ge 0$.
We have $2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) \ge 0$.
We have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca \ge 0$.
We have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca$.

\begin{example}
Problem:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!10, width=\linewidth]
Prove that for any positive real number $x$:
    $$x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2.$$
\end{tcolorbox}

Simplified proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $(x-1)^2 \ge 0$ for all $x$, dividing by $x$ gives $x + \frac{1}{x} - 2 \ge 0$, so $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{example}

Elaborated proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=green!10, width=\linewidth]
Since $(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \ge 0$ for all $x$, dividing by $x$ gives $\frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{x} - 2 \ge 0$, so $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
\end{tcolorbox}

Regularized proof:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!10, width=\linewidth]
Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume $x>0$.
The goal is to prove $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
We have ${\left(x-1\right)}^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 \ge 0$.
We have $\frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x} = x + \frac{1}{x} - 2 \ge 0$ by dividing by $x$.
We have $x + \frac{1}{x} \ge 2$.
